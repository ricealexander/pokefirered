<br><br>
* [ ] **Mewtwo**

  * “Everyone is afraid of that cave on the edge of town. They say people who wander in come out mad.”

This is what you wanted?”_
      <br>[Gives the Secret Key]





<br><br>
## New Battles
These battles become available once the Elite Four is beaten.

  * Daisy is affiliated with Chansey, Pikachu and Clefairy. She could be given friendship evolutions.
  * Her team might include Togetic, Espeon, Azumarill, Blissey

  * He would be encountered in his house. He cares for Nidorino, Psyduck, Cubone, Pidgey, Weedle. He could be given high level unevolved Pokémon with special items or moves. Or he could be given Pokémon that nod to his history on Cinnabar Island, with Team Rocket, or from the anime

  * After Postgame: “I am no ordinary trainer, but even I could not be prepared for the horrors within. But you, you’re the Champion. Maybe you can do what I could not.”

<br><br>
## Physical/Special Split
**Physical/Special Split will not be implemented.**
<br><br>We will not be adding any new Moves because trading compatibility is a requirement of this project. This leaves us with several types that only have viable Physical or viable Special moves and all solutions to this problem deviate from canonical attributes more than I'm comfortable with
<br><br>Some Types that have this issue are Dark (no Special), Fighting (no Special), Flying (no viable Special), Ground (no Special), Poison (no viable Physical), Psychic (no Physical), Rock (only viable Special has 5 PP), Steel (no Special except Doom Desire)
* This open-source project may help [tezemi/pokefirered-updated](https://github.com/tezemi/pokefirered-updated)
  * [ ] Each move is Physical or Special
  * [ ] Moves are labelled Physical or Special
  * [ ] Hidden Power is a Special Move





<br><br>
## Pokémon Box Link / PC Anywhere
**Pokémon Box Link will not be implemented.**
<br><br>While I love the portable PC, we would need to take sure it’s still balanced. HM-using Pokémon and long challenging dungeons are both very much in the spirit of Kanto and easy access to all boxed Pokémon may jeopardize this
* [ ] Named “Pokémon Box Link” and uses Let’s Go’s sprite
* [ ] Given by Professor Oak’s Aide once Brock is defeated
* Running Shoes will be available from the start, so it makes sense that Pokémon Box Link is given here. The Aide should have dialogue explaining the control mappings
* [ ] A Key Item that can be registered to Select
* Pressing R in the Party Menu will also open the PC System
* It is also mapped in place of the Help Menu in the overworld
* [ ] Pokémon do not heal when deposited into the PC
* [ ] Healing at a Pokémon Center heals all Pokémon
* [ ] Cannot be used in the Pokémon League
