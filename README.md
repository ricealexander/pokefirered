# Pokémon FireRed / LeafGreen Rejuvinated
# Fire Red Rejuvinated /<br>Leaf Green Luxuriated

We’ve seen Kanto time and time again. In Red/Blue/Yellow, Gold/Silver/Crystal, FireRed/LeafGreen, HeartGold/SoulSilver, Let’s Go Pikachu & Eevee. Despite this, we have never seen a complete version of Kanto with all core mechanics in tact, all dungeons and locations explorable, and extended Gen 1 Pokémon lines available.

This project builds the definitive version of Kanto. Core mechanics are polished, modern features and quality of life standards are incorporated. This should be the most fleshed out version of Kanto possible while embracing the spirit of the original games.

If you would like to build off of this project, you are welcome to fork it or reuse any code, so long as you include appropriate credits.
